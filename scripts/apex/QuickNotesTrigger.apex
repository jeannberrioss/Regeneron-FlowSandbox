Step 1: Create a Trigger Handler Class and Basic Framework. We will create a dedicated Apex class (e.g., FeedItemTriggerHandler) to house all the trigger logic. This class will have methods to handle each trigger event (beforeInsert, afterInsert, beforeUpdate, afterUpdate, beforeDelete, afterDelete). We will also modify the trigger to simply delegate control to this handler class.

Step 2: Move Existing Insert and Update Logic to the Handler. We will take the existing code from the trigger's after insert and after update blocks and move it into the afterInsert and afterUpdate methods in the FeedItemTriggerHandler class respectively. We will ensure the logic functions the same way as it currently does after this move.

Step 3: Implement beforeDelete Logic to Store Previous Latest_Chatter_Post__c Values. We will add a beforeDelete method in the handler. In this method, we will query the RGC_Data_Assets__c records before the FeedItem deletion occurs and store their current Latest_Chatter_Post__c values in a map, keyed by the RGC_Data_Assets__c record ID. This will allow us to access the "previous" value after deletion.

Step 4: Modify afterDelete Logic to Handle Deletion Correctly. We will then modify the afterDelete method in the handler. In this method, we will:

Retrieve the stored "previous" Latest_Chatter_Post__c values from the map created in beforeDelete.

Re-query for the latest remaining 'TextPost' for each affected RGC_Data_Assets__c record after the deletion.

Based on whether there are remaining 'TextPosts' and the stored previous value, update the Latest_Chatter_Post__c field correctly according to requirements #4 and #5 (revert to previous or set to NULL).

Step 5: Comprehensive Testing. We will write comprehensive test classes to cover all trigger events (insert, update, delete) and scenarios, including:

Inserting a new 'TextPost'.

Updating an existing 'TextPost'.

Deleting a 'TextPost' (and ensuring it reverts to the previous value).

Deleting the last 'TextPost' (and ensuring it sets to NULL).

Bulk operations.

Edge cases and null values.

Step 6: Code Review and Refinement. After testing and ensuring all requirements are met, we will review the code for:

Adherence to Apex best practices.

Code readability and maintainability.

Governor limit considerations and efficiency.

Clear comments and documentation.

Is this step-by-step plan okay with you? Shall we proceed with Step 1?
