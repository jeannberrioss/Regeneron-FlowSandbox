# My Core Development

Hello there! I am currently a salesforce developer with a background in applied mathematics building cool automations, scripts and dev tools. I do not upload much of my progress but I am going to start adding and committing to this new repo. I am currently fascinated by apex programming and its AMAZING capacity to extend the SF platform. I am currently building internal automations, developer tools and scripts that cut lots of time. I am super passionate and always diving deep into low-latency, high performance optimizations for highly critical infrastructure. Current projects are very wide-range but always within constrained evnrionments. I feel like this passion lets me be more creative as I try to use all of the resources at my dispotal to ensure I can build something that works at a high-speeds.
